# Dash OSS Workshop

Welcome to the Dash workshop! This hands-on session will walk you through building an interactive, data/web application using the Dash framework and Plotly visualizations. The workshop is designed as a **code-along** so we will go through each exercise in this workshop together.

## What We'll Cover

I'll introduce the key concepts of Dash and progressively build out an application using several open-source component libraries and Plotly visualizations.

### âš¡ What is Dash?

[Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) is a Python framework for building interactive web applications without JavaScript. Itâ€™s ideal for data scientists and analysts who want to share insights through custom web interfaces using only Python. You can find some example Dash applications [here](https://dash.gallery/Portal/).

### ðŸ“Š What is Plotly?

[Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) is a powerful open-source graphing library for Python. It enables the creation of interactive, publication-quality visualizations across a wide variety of chart types â€” from line plots to 3D surfaces.

## Libraries Weâ€™ll Use

Throughout the workshop, weâ€™ll use a few key libraries:

- ðŸ§© [Dash Core Components (DCC)](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-core-components): Basic interactive components like dropdowns, sliders, and graphs.
- ðŸŽ¨ [Dash Mantine Components (DMC)](https://www.dash-mantine-components.com/): A library of beautiful, customizable UI components.
- ðŸ“¦ [Dash Bootstrap Components (DBC)](https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/docs/components/): Layout and UI components styled with Bootstrap.
- ðŸ“Š [Dash AG Grid](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-ag-grid): A powerful and fast table component for displaying and editing large datasets.

## Workshop Format

- The workshop is organized into a series of **exercises**.
- Each exercise contains a **step-by-step coding task**.
- Youâ€™ll code along with me during the session.
- Once an exercise is completed, weâ€™ll move on to the next one.
- Each new exercise will include:
  - The **solution** to the previous exercise
  - A new set of instructions to complete
- This way each exercise adds one layer of complexity to the application

## Dataset

This workshop uses the [Netflix Titles dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows), which contains metadata about TV shows and movies available on Netflix. Itâ€™s a simple and approachable dataset that works well for interactive visualizations and dashboards.

If youâ€™re interested in exploring other datasets, a great place to start is [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), where youâ€™ll find thousands of open datasets across a wide range of topics.
